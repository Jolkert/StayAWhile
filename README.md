# Stay A While
Have you ever thought that your items disappear to quickly? Or maybe you think its actually too short. Perhaps the normal timer is just fine, but you wish you had just a little more time to collect your tiems after you die. Or maybe you want your items to despawn faster to give death that little extra stress factor.  
Whichever type of player you are, Stay A While is the mod for you

# What does it do?
Stay A While adds two gamerules
* `deathItemDespawnAge` the amount of ticks an item that **was dropped by a player upon death** takes to despawn (default: 6000)
* `itemDespawnAge` the amount of ticks all other dropped items take to despawn (default: 6000)

In case you are unfamiliar with them, **20 ticks == 1 second**  
Any value less than 0 (i.e. negative values) are interpreted to mean "never despawn"

# Other questions you might want answers to
## Does this work on servers?
Yes! Just install on the server and you're good to go. No players need to install!

## What if I change the value while items are still on the ground?
Any items dropped on the ground should retain the maximum age they had from the time they were dropped
